The user is capable of setting several configurations of alarm triggers. When someone steps into these configurations, the user is able to tell that someone has triggered the given area. Configurations include:$- Up to a 10ft by 10ft by 10ft cube area. The user can tell from where they entered, and from inside or outside the cube$- Tripwire up to 20ft long, though it has to be in a straight line (no going around corners to cover multiple areas)$- A touched surface up to 3sqft$Downsides:$- The user does not know the identity of the person going through alarm triggers$- The user becomes increasingly strained mentally when they set more alarm triggers, as their mind has to focus on each one
