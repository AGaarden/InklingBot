Emitter
The user of this quirk has a special saliva that allows the creation of bubbles through exhaling and using their hands to hold the bubble as it forms. The saliva the bubbles are made of is volatile and if they pop they will explode. The explosion’s power is relative to the size of the bubble so small ones are relatively weak, meanwhile larger ones can cause more damage.$The bubbles are able to float in the air for about a minute before the structure of the bubble fails along with the saliva becoming inert. Due to the saliva of the user not being normal they are prone to dry mouth and running out if they make too many bubbles. The bubbles don’t become reactive until 5 seconds after creation as such popping them will have no effect. The user is not immune to the explosion of the bubbles.
