Emitter
This quirk allows the user to make themselves imperceptible to all five senses of a normal human. At the cost of the user losing the sense themselves. The degree of sensory loss can be controlled, so the user could choose to make their own vision blurry, in exchange to appear blurry to everyone else around him. This quirk can be extended to another person, in which case both the receiver and the user lose the associated sense. This quirk can also be applied to objects, at a lesser sensory cost. Making a ball imperceptible to the naked eye might cost you a pair of glasses, but at least it's not blindness.$Downsides:$The total loss of the associated sense can be both an upside and a downside. Choose to use this quirk on a hostile, and they will also lose the sense. So if you make a bad guy invisible, you also make them blind. It also requires contact with the object or person you want to fade. Either direct, or through another, already faded object, like a string.
