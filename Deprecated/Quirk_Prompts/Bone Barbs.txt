Mutation
The user's body has several bone spikes, about twenty centimetres long, jutting out the back of their hands, their elbow, their knees, and one at the small of their back. Each of these barbs has a five-meter-long tendon attached at their base and can be fired with enough force to pierce flesh. Once in, the spikes sprout barbs into the surrounding flesh, anchoring themselves. Any attempts to remove these barbs normally end up in the wound being ripped open and a chunk of flesh missing. The barb at the back is more specialized, the tendons there allow it a greater range of movement, so more of a tail than a harpoon. $Downsides:$The spikes have been specialized to pierce flesh, and the force that they are launched at is just enough for them to sink in, so metal, stone, even multiple layers of clothing will stop the spike dead in its tracks. Once launched, spikes have to be reeled back in before they can be launched again, the exception being the back spike.
