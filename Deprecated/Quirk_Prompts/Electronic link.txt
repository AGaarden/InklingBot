This quirk allows the quirk user to link with a powered electronic device with 5 meters of them. They only need to be able to know the exact location in relation to the user to be able to link with it. This link allows them access to the deviceâ€™s data, as well as processing power, for the purpose of gathering information. In extension of this, they can use whatever connection the device has to a wider network, potentially granting them access to several devices at a time for processing power and information gathering. The user possesses an algorithmic ability, allowing them to spearhead the devices they have control over for the purpose of cracking passwords and encryptions in a highly efficient manner. $The downsides are several. Firstly, this is purely a supportive quirk. The user has no control over the functions of the device. For example, the user can allocate the few resources an RC car has to figure out what connection it has, but not drive it around. Additionally, they are unable to just bypass a password, as the sister quirk Electronic Dominance can. This connection to the computers require a fair bit of control and mental energy/capacity on the part of the user to keep up, slowly getting more and more taxing with the more things they take over.
