Emitter
This quirk allows the user to be an artificial catalyst for chemical and physical reactions and changes, as well as an influence to the flow and movement of atoms. The user draws energy from around them (thermal, chemical, electrical), or, if there’s not enough, from inside of them. They then use this energy to trigger physical changes such as freezing or evaporating liquids, melting solids, etc. Chemical changes include reactions such as oxidizing (rusting) metal, sparking flammable materials, turning coal into diamonds, and others such as splitting compounds (example, breaking water into hydrogen and oxygen), or combining/rearranging atoms to form new compounds.$Downsides:$The user must understand the changes they’re triggering, on a molecular level, or they won’t work. Also, they can’t just go around liquefying the ground in huge areas or something like that, due to the power being incredibly taxing, and due to the starting distance limit being at most 15 feet. If the power is overused, the user risks getting minor, temporary magnetic poisoning. And, as mentioned earlier, energy must be drawn from around them, so the power would be more effective in hotter places, areas with more static electricity, or lush places due to the chemical energy in plants. Lastly, transmutation can’t be used on animals or humans.
