This quirk allows the user to manipulate speed and trajectory of small moving objects in a small radius around the user. User is capable of redirecting the path of small moving objects within the field, and may continue to do so as long as they stay within the field. User is also able to speed up and slow down objects, but the rate of acceleration/deceleration and the range of speed change is dependent on the user's control over the quirk.$Downsides:$Inanimate objects only are affected. Objects can only be manipulated if the user can carry the object normally with one hand. Objects also need to be in motion for the quirk to have effect: stationary objects are immune until they start moving. Any objects heavier can only be manipulated to a certain extent (cannot redirect as well or speed up/slow down) and are often unreliable or impossible to control. Objects need to be individually controlled, and tire out the user mentally depending on the number of objects controlled, how long, and how much they're affecting the objects in terms of speed and trajectory. Overexertion may cause dizziness, headaches, nausea, and if overexerted too much, may cause weakness and even blackouts.
