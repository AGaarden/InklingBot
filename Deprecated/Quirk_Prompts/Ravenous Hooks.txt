Mutation
The user of this quirk possesses four 100 foot spools of fishing line like material that is even more durable than normal fishing line. The user also possesses 10 hooks in their wrists that they can attach to the end of the line. The user can unwind the line both by unspooling the line and by throwing like a fishing pole with their arms. The user is capable of retracting the line with 500 pounds of torque at a rate of 3 revolutions per second.$Downsides:$Though lines of the user are capable of supporting a large amount of mass, snapping at 600 pounds of tension, the line is easily cut due to how thin they are. The user creates the hooks and lines and as a result has a limited amount before needing to wait a month before producing the maximum amount possible. the hooks must be attached to the lines manually making replacement mid combat extremely difficult.
