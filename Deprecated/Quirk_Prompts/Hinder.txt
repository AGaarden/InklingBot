Mutation
Hinder removes all detriments from the user’s body that may hinder the user. Such hindrances are pain, temperature change, hunger, thirst, fatigue, sensory overload, and blood loss. It also rapidly cures the user of poisons, diseases, and drugs.$Downsides:$Although the hindrances are removed, the user is not invincible, but arguably worse off on a day to day basis. Temperature change, fatigue, hunger, and thirst cannot be detected, but still exist within the body, meaning the user can blackout, dehydrate, starve, or suffer from temperature related ailments without realizing it. Self-inflicted injuries and wounds are also common due to the user’s inability to detect them. Physical attributes also receive no boosts.
