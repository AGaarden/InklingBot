Emitter
Please, for the sake of relevant comedy in the role of this quirk's creation, imagine the user is also a pirate. The user's body can convert Vitamin C obtained from external, preferably citrus based sources into stem cells, which can appropriately and rapidly be called upon to quickly heal any minor injury. Particularly large doses of vitamin C can supercharge this quirk's ability, allowing injuries as serious as heavy blood loss or even severed limbs to be regrown, at the cost of being completely or nearly unconscious for the entirety of the regeneration process.
