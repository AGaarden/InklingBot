Emitter
People who stare at the users exposed skin become disillusioned with reality; Gravity feels wrong, their sense of smell and taste are reversed, touching something makes them feel like nothing is there, and their balance is thrown heavily off. Looking away or closing their eyes will immediately stop the effects.$Downsides:$Looking into a mirror also affects the user as much as anyone else, and the effect cannot be disabled or filtered. Allies, enemies, and strangers are all equally affected, making the user have to wear a full body suit if they want to interact at a regular level.
