Emitter
The user is able to control mechanical puppets through strings and attunement. When the person has gotten attuned to the puppet in question, usually taking a couple of hours, they are able to control individual functions with every string, fx moving legs, moving arms, or controlling a lid. They may also get vision through the puppet with an additional string. These strings have a maximum of 20 meters. The more strings they use for a given puppet, the faster they are. $Downsides:$The strings are able to be cut, and are considerably less durable the more they use on a given puppet. They are also using a great deal of focus in order to control a puppet, even more so if controlling multiple. As such, training with this quirk is near inevitable to use it properly and optimally.
