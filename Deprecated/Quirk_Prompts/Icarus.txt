Mutation
The user of this quirk can form wings out of a wax like substance that the user sweats. The wings can last pretty long at night, but will slowly melt in the sun. The hotter it is the faster they will melt. The user of this quirk can use the melting wax as a weapon against opponents by flicking it at them. This is not an effective method of combat, unless there is a lot of wax.$Downsides:$Forming the wings can drain a lot of energy, making the user tired quickly. The user cannot use their quirk well in high temperatures. If the wings melt, the user cannot reform them for at least 30 minutes or their energy will be completely drained and they will pass out. If the temperature drops below 0 degrees celsius, the wings will become brittle and break. If the wings melt or break when the user is in the air, the user will fall (duh).
