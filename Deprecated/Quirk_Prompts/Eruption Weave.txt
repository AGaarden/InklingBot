Mutation
The userâ€™s hair is made out of molten rock from the neck down, being able to stretch and move around like a lava flow. The user is able to control the heat and viscosity of the lava by concentrating and monitoring their adrenaline levels, and can move their head around to redirect the way it moves. By calming down, they can also shape it into a large blade of obsidian, which can cut most substances not stronger than it.$Downsides:$The hair has to be kept carefully in check so as to not damage those around them constantly, and extreme moods cause it to flair up and grow in size. When the user is asleep their hair cools into obsidian no matter how intense their dreams get, and takes some time to reheat even if they wake up to danger.
