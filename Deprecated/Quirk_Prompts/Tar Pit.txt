The user is able to pour tar from every sweat gland in their body, making a sticky, flammable solution that clings to them and expands outward. Able to give loose shaping to the exuded substance, they can create basic items out of it such as walls or whips made of tar. $Downsides:$Fire ignites the tar incredibly easily, a few sparks being enough to start an inferno. Extended use can cause the user to become heavily dehydrated as their water stores deplete. Stealth is practically impossible due to the bubbling sound released, as well as the trail of liquid behind them.
