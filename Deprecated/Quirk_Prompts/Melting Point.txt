Emitter
The user of this quirk is able to heat inanimate, solid materials that the person touches, up to the melting point of the given material. The temperature that the user heats this material up to can be coarsely adjusted by the user. The applications of the quirk includes bending metals, melting sand into glass, welding items together, and the like.$Downsides:$- Overuse of the quirk may induce heatstroke$- As the temperature is only very coarsely adjustable, specific temperatures are very hard to manage (i.e. you canâ€™t temper chocolate using the quirk)
