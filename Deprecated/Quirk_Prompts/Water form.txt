Mutation
The users body is made of water, of which they are able to control the liquidity. The user has no bone structure and can't carry very much as they're made of water. The more liquid they are the less they can support herself. At their most liquidated they're just a puddle of water and at their least liquidated they have a human shape, although they are still translucent and looking like water. Even though they're made of water they can still be injured by attacks except for puddle form.$Downsides:$Changing the liquidity of their body takes a lot of energy and can't be held for long periods of time. In addition to that they can both lose and gain water through any means of nature. If the holder were to enter a large body of water, they could easily lose themselves and be reduced to a fraction of their former self.
