Mutation
The user possesses a mouth in the palm of both hands. These hands are able to consume metals, which physically deposit themselves on the user’s body. These deposits usually deposit themselves on the back of the user, and sort themselves by the metals. The user is capable of using this stored metal to shape and launch the metal from their back at a speed comparable to that of a fastball. $Downsides: $- The deposits add to the user’s weight so too much stored up will weigh them down. Alongside that the user's body takes time to process the metal before being usable.
